# Outline

This notebook outlines the creation of a plotly plot, submitted for the Developing Data Products Coursera course, on Week 3. I have chosen to use a dataset from Ireland, the .
```{r include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(plotly)


```

Looking at the data, a couple of interesting features might be;  
* the earliest date attributed to the site
* the number of sites by county

This involves three dimensions so quite possibly a heatmap might be the best option? We will use ggplot to produce the plot and then build a ggplotly object for the final output..


```{r produce_plot}
niah_data %>% 
  count(ORIGINAL_TYPE)


```
